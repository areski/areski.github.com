In the last years, I have been working on many open source projects,
lately I spent most of my time between those Newfies-Dialer and CDR-Stats.
Being author and maintainer of continuous developing project is a lot of work and
as many developers, I ended up putting all my efforts and free time into those products.
My own blog has been a disaster for many years, I even wondered how the website is still up.
I started my previous blog 9 years ago, I did few posts the first months, with a lot of motivations,
and then it losts his way...

I guess at that time I didn't had a clear idea why I wanted to keep a blog, neither did I know anything about the audience,
but the lack of motivation is certainly because I was missing a clear purpose, what I wanted to talk about.
A blog is not about yourself, it's about sharing. Sharing ideas, sharing something you learnt.
I learnt to share with opensource communities, I learn how to give and I learnt how to receive and appreciate efforts of other,
and mostly value those.
I have a clear idea what I want to share with peoples, experience, knowleges, things I learnt hardly, obviously what I want to
share is what matter to me.

So What do I want to talk about here?
-------------------------------------
Well I'm a Python adict, also an entrepreneur for the last years, I'm very interested into better programming and deployment,
Continuous integration, Testing, but most of all I love telefony!

There is plenty of things to tell about those things, no ? and most of all
plenty of peoples willing to learn and share about them.

So here it comes out of my pocket, just few ideas for a first blog post:
    - Introduction to FreeSWITCH
    - Why Newfies-Dialer ? Telemarketing danger!
    - MongoDB 2.2, aggregation
    - Django and Travis-CI
    - DevOps with Salt

Maybe write some good recipes and tutorials, I hope by the time you read this,
one of those will be fully covered :)


/Seeu pronto
